# Physics-Project
This is my journey with doing physic related projects and programs

# Plans for the future
Every Project here will be done through VS code 2022
Later there will be a move to using Unreal engine for 3D modeling,
but I will be making my own 3D modeling code if possible on my machine.
That will intail full lighting and shading with depth.

# A 2D Pendulum
this will be the first project that takes in account for real time physics 
with out air resistance at first

#A 2D double Pendulem 
same as first but now two of them

# Water molecule simulation 
small scale water simulation where there is a few atoms that attrack 
one another but are squished down by gravity

# Water flow 
Have my molecule simulation move when introducing and object into a larger 
group of molecules and have them adjust with respects to the simple laws of 
fluid mechanics

# Buoyancy
Have objects float in or on water depending on their density

# Air
Use the same code for water but have it changed so for air 
sits on top of water and add Viscosity for resistance 

# Pendulem with air resistance
Incorperate the pendulem to be affected by air ressistance
